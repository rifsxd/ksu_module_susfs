# A KernelSU module for SUSFS patched kernel #

This module installs a userspace helper tool called **ksu_susfs** and **sus_su** into /data/adb/ksu and provides a script to communicate with SUSFS kernel.
This module provides root hiding for KernelSU on the kernel level.

## Notes
- Make sure you have a custom kernel with SUSFS patched in it. Check the custom kernel source to see if it has SUSFS.
- Make sure the kernel is using SUSFS 1.5.2 or later for effective hide.
- Shamiko v1.2.1 or later is acceptable (but it's highly optional to use it)
- HideMyApplist is acceptable
- ReVanced root module compatible
- Recommended to use [bindhosts](https://github.com/backslashxx/bindhosts) if you want to use systemless hosts

## Spoofing Kernel Uname guide on Revision 16+
In the new R16 of SUSFS includes a new parameter called "Spoof Kernel Build". this may confuse some users about what those are.

In the kernel version it affects this part:
```
6.1.75-android14-11-g16c5f6cd5e9b-ab12268515
```
While on the Kernel Build part is this:
```
#1 SMP PREEMPT Fri Aug 23 03:08:10 UTC 2024
```
You may check them by using these commands:
```
#This is for the Kernel Version
uname -r
#This is for the Kernel Build
uname -v
```

## Adding ro.boot.vbmeta.digest value
This module will now have a directory called `VerifiedBootHash` in `/data/adb` containing `VerifiedBootHash.txt` for users with missing `ro.boot.vbmeta.digest` value to prevent partition modified and abnormal boot state detection. 
- Copy your VerifiedBootHash in the Key Attestation demo and paste it to `/data/adb/VerifiedBootHash/VerifiedBootHash.txt`

## Localization (CI Version)
If you want to contribute to add your own language, use the `webui` branch and add your translations in the `./languages` directory. Make sure to test the implementation thoroughly before submitting a pull request.
Also, the name of the XML files should be the same as the language code, for example:
- For English, the file should be named `en.xml`
- For Spanish, the file should be named `es.xml`

Don't worry; it will release officially soon ðŸ˜Š
